                    <p>The Special Collections department houses an incredible amount of historically significant items. Their website was old and needed an update. Patrons were reporting that they were unable to find out how to access even the most often-used links and pages on the old site, and the site was not responsive.</p>
                    <p>I was tasked with creating a new website for the department.</p>

                    <p>Any of the 60+ BYU Library web projects—not always UX related—can be added or removed from my project queue at any time based on priority, time contraints, or other reasons. </p>
                    <p>As project priorities change, a project that only requires 1-8 months of total design and development time often end up spanning up to a year and a half—or more—from start to finish.</p>

                        <p>I also worked with the department to determine which content to keep, toss, and add for the new site.</p>

                        <p>Once I had determined requirements and content for the new site, I went straight to designing the site to integrate as a Services page within the main website. Since there was already an existing style guide for Services pages—I skipped wireframe mockups and went straight to high-fidelity mockups.</p>

                            <p>Each of the pages included in the mockup represent new page template that would need to be created for the Services pages—all other links from the home page were existing pages or their copy content fit one of the existing or newly created templates.</p>
                            <p>Once I was done and had reviewed multiple iterations with the stakeholders and the back-end dev for the project, I handed the mockups off to developer who implemented the design for usability testing</p>
