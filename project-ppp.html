                    <p>As project priorities change, a project that only requires 1-8 months of total design and development time often end up spanning up to a year and a half—or more—from start to finish.</p>

                            <p>I initally began iterating design solutions using wireframes. Instead of testing these wireframes using InVision—like I have on every project since—I met with all of the stakeholders as a group to review the wireframes and get feedback.</p>
                            <p>Once the stakeholders had said that I had designed for each piece of functionality they would need, I moved on to high fidelity mockups.</p>
