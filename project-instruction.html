                    <p>There was an existing application that was failing to meet the needs of librarians, students and administrators. I was tasked with designing a new system.</p>

                    <p>As project priorities change, a project that only requires 6-8 months of total design and development time—like this one—often end up spanning up to a year and a half—or more—from start to finish.</p>

                        <p>I interviewed multiple individuals from each of the user roles—see below—and asked them how they used the existing system in order to identify the jobs-to-be-done for each user role. I asked what frustrated them about it, what they liked about it, what they felt was missing. Then I oberserved how they used the current system.</p>
                        <p>I also interviewed the stakeholders—members of the Library Instruction department—to seek to better understand the problems they thought the new system needed to solve.</p>

                            <p>For this project, I used the jobs-to-be-done framework to understand and design for meeting user needs and goals. There were dozens of jobs-to-be-done that I create for each user group, but these give a general overview.</p>
                            <h4>FOR THE STUDENTS</h4>

                            <h4>IN GENERAL</h4>
                            <p>Most jobs-to-be-done for each of the user groups fell into one of three periods of time that made up an instruction block within the application:</p>

                            <p>For the first few weeks of the learning and understanding phase I assumed that I knew what the librarians and students wanted and needed in the new application.</p>
                            <p>After getting all the way to high fidelity wireframes, the stakeholders finally said what I had designed wouldn’t work for many reasons. I started over by doing user interviews, contextual inquiry, and stakeholder interviews first—something I now do for every project.</p>

                        <p>With interviews and contextual inquires done, I moved on to diagramming, designing, and prototyping an interface for the students and the librarians to use across the three time periods—polling, scheduling, and instruction.</p>
                        <p>The administrator’s dashboard was created using the Django dashboard.</p>

                            <p>At this point I began building what I had designed in HTML and SCSS, and continued to iterate. I eventually sent the other front-end developer the back-end devlopers the interaction design doc with instructions for the JavaScript functionality on the frontend, and met with developers to talk about how the backend would need to be architected in order to support the functionality of the front-end.</p>
